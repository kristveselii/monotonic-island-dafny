# monotonic-island-dafny
Implementation of a verified Dafny algorithm that finds the largest monotonic island (strictly increasing or decreasing subsequence) in an integer array. Includes formal proofs for algorithm termination, valid output indices, and optimal solution using loop invariants and predicates.
